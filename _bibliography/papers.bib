  abstract =   {In this paper, we present an effective and efficient structural inference approach by integrating a Reservoir Computing (RC) network into a Variational Auto-encoder-based (VAE-based) structural inference framework. With the help of Bi-level Optimization, the backbone VAE-based method follows the Information Bottleneck principle and infers a general adjacency matrix in its latent space; the RC net substitutes the partial role of the decoder and encourages the whole approach to perform further steps of gradient descent based on limited available data. The experimental results on various datasets including biological networks, simulated fMRI data, and physical simulations show the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method for structural inference, either with much fewer trajectories or with much shorter trajectories compared with previous works.}

  abstract =   {In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Active Learning based Structural Inference (ALaSI), to infer the existence of directed connections from observed agentsâ€™ states over a time period in a dynamical system. With the help of deep active learning, ALaSI is competent in learning the representation of connections with a relatively small pool of prior knowledge. Moreover, based on information theory, the proposed inter- and out-of-scope message learning pipelines are remarkably beneficial to structural inference for large dynamical systems. We evaluate ALaSI on various large datasets including simulated systems and real-world networks, to demonstrate that ALaSI is able to outperform previous methods in precisely inferring the existence of connections in large systems under either supervised learning or unsupervised learning.}
