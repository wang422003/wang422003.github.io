I am a researcher at the Shanghai AI Laboratory in Shanghai, China.

My current research interests are: 1. multi-model models for scientific discovery; 2. formal reasoning and equation discovery; 3. structural inference of dynamical systems with deep learning. I am interested in helping researchers and machines to discover this fantastic world.
