I am a PhD Student in computer science in the [Faculty of Science, Technology and Medicine](https://www.uni.lu/fstm-en/) at the [University of Luxembourg](https://www.uni.lu/en/) in Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.

My research is at the structural inference of dynamical systems with deep learning, which is at the interface of ODEs, Generative Models and Variational Methods. I am interested in helping researchers and machines to understand the interactions between the entities.
